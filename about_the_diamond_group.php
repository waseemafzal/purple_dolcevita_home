                At Diamond Group, we make products every day that make a difference to the lives of every day

                Pakistanis. Products that enhance their quality of life, products that keep them and their loved ones 

                safe, products that provide comfort and rest, and products that help them save on their energy 

                consumption for smarter homes and businesses. 

                We have always challenged the norm and always set new benchmarks of excellence with superior 

                quality products such as Diamond Supreme Foam- Pakistan’s Superior & No.1 Quality Foam, Diamond 

                Tyres, Dolce Vita-a standalone product brand developed with sleep science & technology partners from 

                Europe and North America benchmarking Pakistan’s Only Global Standard Luxury Sleep Systems with 

                Advanced Pocket Spring Engineering, and Jumbolon-a revolutionary insulation product that has made us 

                a market leader and only quality manufacturer in its category helping to define national regulation 

                standards along the way for an Energy Smart Pakistan.

                In 2015, we have achieved a global benchmark with the introduction of The Supreme SmartGel- the 

                World’s First Smart Mattress. Developed with our global partners and technologies; this dual sided sleep 

                system serves the function of providing cooler sleep in summer and warmer regulated body to mattress 

                temperature for uninterrupted sleep during winter.

                Over the last 18 months, we have invested further in added infrastructure to rise to the challenge of 

                seeking sustainable manufacturing processes and quality improvements that meet global trends and 

                standards in the furniture industry. We have defined with international consultants the highest 

                standards that embody the design processes, raw materials sourcing and the investment in the training 

                of skilled labor that can deliver the finished product.

                We are pleased to say that the response from our customers and seekers of genuine luxury goods has 

                been overwhelming positive. With 10 stores opened nationwide over the span of just 12 months, Dolce 

                Vita Home is Pakistan’s fastest growing luxury furniture and accessories brand, and is defining new 

                benchmarks when it comes to meeting the high and almost impeccable standards that one is to expect 

                of a luxury brand on par with the very best in the world.

                We thank all our customers and partners that have supported and stood by us over the last 40 years, 

                We remain committed to you and committed to our new customers as we stay on course, in the pursuit 

                of perfection.
